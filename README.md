# OrbitPy

This package contain set of modules to compute *mission-data* of satellites. It can be used to perform the following calculations:

1. Generation of satellite orbits from constellation specifications.
2. Computation of propagated satellite state (position and velocity) data.
3. Generation of grid points at a (user-defined or auto) angular resolution over region of interest.
4. *Grid Coverage*: Computation of satellite access intervals over given set of grid points (*grid-coverage*) for the length of the mission.

        i. With consideration of satellite/sensor pointing (orientation) directions.
        ii. With consideration of sensor field-of-view (FOV) and field-of-regard (FOR).
5. *Pointing-options Coverage:* Computation of coverage in which set of pointing-options of the satellite/instrument are specified and accessed ground-locations (intersection of the pointing-axis with the Earth's surface) is calculated.
6. *Pointing-options with Grid Coverage*: Grid Coverage calculated for different satellite/instrument orientations.
7. *Specular Coverage*: Calculation of specular points and grid points inside the specular regions. Several source (transmitter) satellites may be specified, and the receiver satellite/sensor orientation and FOV is taken into consideration.
8. Computation of inter-satellite communication (line-of-sight) time intervals.
9. Computation of ground-station contact time intervals.
10. Computation of satellite eclipse time-intervals.
11. (Under dev) Sensor pixel-array projection to simulated Level-2 satellite imagery.

The `orbitpy` package is built on top of the `propcov` package available in the `propcov` folder. Please refer to the `README.MD` file within the `propcov` folder for description of the respective package.

## Install

Requires: Unix-like operating system, `python 3.8`, `pip`, `gcc-11`, `make`, `cmake`

It is recommended to carry out the installation in a `conda` environment. Instructions are available in the README file of the InstruPy package.

1.  Install the `instrupy` package (dependency).

2.  Run `make` from the main repo directory.

    All the below dependencies are automatically installed. If any errors are encountered please check that the following dependencies are installed. Install the dependencies separately and then run `make`.

    * `numpy`
    * `pandas`
    * `scipy`
    * `sphinx`
    * `sphinx_rtd_theme==0.5.2`
    * `propcov`

3.  Run `make runtest`. This runs all the tests and can be used to verify the package.

4.  Find the documentation in: `/docs/_build/html/index.html#`

In order to uninstall run `make bare` in the terminal.


---
**NOTE**

The OrbitPy installation automatically installs the package `propcov` which consists of python binding of C++ classes which provide the functionality for orbit propagation, coverage calculations and sensor pixel-array projection. The python bound C++ objects are implemented in OrbitPy.

The `make runtest` does *not* run the tests of the `propcov` library. Please see the `README.MD` in the `propcov` folder on how to run it's tests.

Documentation of the `propcov` library is available in the Word document `propcov/docs/propcov-cpp.docx`.

Mac users have reported errors in the installation of `propcov`. This mostly relates to the environmental setup in which wrong C++ compiler is selected for compilation. Please see the `README.MD` in the `propcov` for debug information.

## Developer Tasks

### Restructuring notes

- Need to account for spacecraft bus orientation in coverage calculations 
- Use datetime module for storing time and time-delta
- Think about how to represent large volumes of output data (propagation, coverage). Currently it is in the form of files, and file I/O operations are performed. Should we also offer other options?
- Tag grid points with 'target ids' (similar to indices) 
- How to ensure unique identifiers for satellties, instruments, grid points, etc?
- Using Quaternion to represent orientation instead of Euler angles.

### OrbitPy
- [ ] SGP4 Propagator validation tests with STK  (or another s/w)
- [ ] Incorporate artificial image synthesis involving the propcov classes `DiscretizedSensor`, `Projector` and the orbitpy `SensorPixelProjection` module. Add python-tests.
- [ ] Search for ‘Vinay’ and ‘TODO’ over all the files

### Propcov-cpp

- [ ] Explore the orbit interpolation functions.
- [ ] Make a C++ SystemTestDriver
- [ ] Add unconventional sensor FOV geometry shapes GTests for `GMATCustomSensor` and `DSPIPCustomSensor` class.
- [ ] Rename `TATCException` to `PropcovCppException`
- [ ] Add GTests for `Spacecraft`, `CoverageChecker`, `NadirPointingAttitude` and other classes. (There are in total 26 propcov-cpp active classes, of which currently there are GTests ofr 15 of these classes. Some tests in the `tests/tests-cpp/old` folder can be rewritten into the GTest format.)
- [ ] Consider avoiding virtual functions since it has runtime costs associated with it??

### Debug Tips
Errors in the propcov-cpp classes are sometime not visible (i.e. not displayed) when the propcov package is installed. The package installation can happen, but import will not work. In such cases run `make` from propcov-cpp -> tests, and debug any errors.
